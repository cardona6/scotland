					General Information?
	</articule>
	<p class="article-lead">Scotland’s name comes from the Scoti, a Celtic tribe who migrated to Scotland from Ireland during the fifth and sixth centuries and who, in time, merged through conquest and intermarriage with the Pictish tribes to form the nucleus of the Scottish nation.
                     English is the main language but, importantly, Gaelic is spoken by some 80,000 of the population.
                     Location. Scotland forms the northern part of the island of Great Britain and is situated between latitudes 54°38’ and 60°51’N and the longitudes 1°45’ and 6°14’W.
                     It is bounded west and north by the Atlantic Ocean and on the east by the North Sea, while in the south the border with England runs 60 miles roughly along the line of the Cheviot Hills.
                     It has an area is 78,772 km2 and it has an estimated population of 5,327,700 in 2013..</p>
