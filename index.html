				<p>Where best to start than on the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond, which is on full view for the most part of this drive. Passing
					along the A82 through the beautiful sights of the Arrochar Alps and then Crianlarich at the head of the loch. After
					passing the spectacular Lochearnhead on the A85, you'll arrive at the A821 and Loch Katrine. Here is the idyllic location
					where you can enjoy a ride on the Sir Walter Scott steamship and witness the picture-perfect views of Scotland's waters..</p>

				<hr>
				<p>Scotland’s name comes from the Scoti, a Celtic tribe who migrated to Scotland from Ireland during the fifth and sixth
					centuries and who, in time, merged through conquest and intermarriage with the Pictish tribes to form the nucleus of
					the Scottish nation. English is the main language but, importantly, Gaelic is spoken by some 80,000 of the population.
					Location. Scotland forms the northern part of the island of Great Britain and is situated between latitudes 54°38’ and
					60°51’N and the longitudes 1°45’ and 6°14’W. It is bounded west and north by the Atlantic Ocean and on the east by the
					North Sea, while in the south the border with England runs 60 miles roughly along the line of the Cheviot Hills. It
					has an area is 78,772 km2 and it has an estimated population of 5,327,700 in 2013..

				<p class="article-lead">Scotland's most famous fortress has dominated the city's skyline since the 13th Century and is the most popular national

					city landmarks including the Royal Mile, Princes Street and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Entrance to the castle is via
					a drawbridge over an old moat from the broad Esplanade where the famous Edinburgh Military Tattoo is held every August.
					On the way, you'll pass bronze statues of legendary heroes William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, both of whom fought
					and defeated the English?

					Pools are a series of clear, cold pools and waterfalls formed as Allt Coir’ a’ Mhadaidh tumbles down from the foothills

				<h2>University of Edinburgh</h2>
				<p>First in our list of top universities in Scotland is the University of Edinburgh, the sixth-oldest university in the
					English-speaking world. and a part of Scotland’s capital city since 1583. The ‘old town’, where the university is rooted,
					is frozen in time with its preserved medieval street plan and reformation-era buildings. Ranked 19th in the world and
					5th in the UK, the University of Edinburgh plays a distinct role in the city’s status as both a hub of knowledge and
					a vibrant cultural center which nurtures fringe theater and comedy ready for the famous Edinburgh Fringe Festival every
					August. </p>

				<h2>University of Glasgow</h2>
				<p>Home to Scotland’s oldest public museum and the largest Scottish university by student population, the University of
					Glasgow is also the fourth-oldest university in the English-speaking world, having been established in 1451. Ranked
					joint 63rd in the world, the University of Glasgow is located in the Hillhead neighborhood in Glasgow’s West End, an
					area known for fashion and cultural diversity. The city’s Victorian architecture is now modishly outfitted with trendy
					but down-to-earth bars and clubs which appeal to the Glaswegian sense of fun, allowing it to compete with Edinburgh
					for the title of Scotland’s cultural capital </p>

			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h2>University of St Andrews</h2>
				<p>Home to around 8,400 students, the University of St Andrews was founded in 1410, making it the oldest of the four ‘ancient
					universities of Scotland’. It’s ranked 77th in the world in 2016-2017, appearing close behind Glasgow in the overall
					rankings and placing 14th among top universities in the UK. A small university town in rural Fife on Scotland’s east
					coast, St Andrews is famous for its golf course as well as its university, where more than a third of the town’s population
					either study or work. With the university playing such a central role in local life, the community atmosphere here is
					hard to beat.</p>
